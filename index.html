        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>
          I started my career thinking I was going to get into the social
          sciences, but in 2018 I found myself wanting to learn how websites
          were made out of curiousity. About a year later and I've decided that
          it is time to pursue full-stack development full time, so here I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a personal level I'm happiest with a dog by my side and whem I'm
          learning something new. I just want to make the world a better place
          for current and future generations.
        </p>
